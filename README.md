The official Python documentation on socket programming was used extensively:
http://docs.python.org/3.3/howto/sockets.html

In addition, open-source program *python-proxy*, developed by FÃ¡bio Domingues,
was used to guide certain parts of our implementation:
https://code.google.com/p/python-proxy/

This code for this program has been placed in the references/ directory,
for your convenience.
